# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to Zakura are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Deterministic attributed-memory accounting for decoded blocks in the
  block-sync pipeline, with per-decode histograms and active-pipeline gauges
  ([#159](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/159)).

### Changed

- Block-sync now keeps its apply backlog in serialized wire form and decodes
  bodies only for the verifier submission window, so decoded memory is bounded
  regardless of backlog depth. Admission accounting charges serialized pools at
  wire size, and the default look-ahead budget is a 1.5 GiB memory target:
  initial-sync memory no longer grows with block era
  ([#190](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/190)). The
  `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX` mitigation from
  [#148](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/148) remains as the
  complementary allocator-retention layer.

### Fixed

- Prevent initial sync from stalling at checkpoint boundaries by refilling the
  verifier submission window after stale apply completions
  ([#215](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/215)).
- Header sync now keeps timed-out ranges in a bounded, single-owner work queue,
  retries them indefinitely with short peer-local avoidance, and commits
  pipelined responses in height order
  ([#138](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/138)).
- Stop header-sync maintenance from repeatedly waking on a stale VCT repair
  retry deadline while the repair request is still in flight, and honor the
  configured status refresh interval from startup
  ([#218](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/218)).
- Pruned finalized blocks remain visible to chain-identity queries, including peer
  block-hash responses and RPC confirmation lookups, after their bodies are removed
  ([#133](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/133)).
- Stop pruned nodes from serving fabricated zero transaction counts and auth-data
  roots when a historical block body is unavailable during Zakura header sync
  ([#133](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/133)).
- Bind VCT prevalidation reuse to the block's height, canonical hash, and
  authorizing-data root, and reject cached same-block bodies with altered
  authorizing data as permanently invalid instead of parking them for retry
  ([#208](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/208)).
- Source VCT successor witnesses only from contextually validated headers and
  their persisted authorizing-data roots, so a buffered block body with altered
  authorizing data can no longer evict a valid supplied root and stall header
  sync ([#212](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/212)).
- Serve `BlockRoots` responses for every requested finalized height, including
  heights whose blocks added no Sapling commitments, so header sync no longer
  stalls on false coverage gaps
  ([#202](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/202)).
- Invalidating a block at a chain's non-finalized root now removes every fork
  built on that block, not just the chain with the matching tip
  ([#202](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/202)).
- Reject Mainnet-shaped Equihash solutions on Regtest: each network now accepts
  only its own Equihash parameter variant, matching zcashd
  ([#202](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/202)).
- Generated local-genesis networks activating NU6.1 or later now satisfy the
  one-time lockbox disbursement rule instead of rejecting every possible
  activation block ([#202](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/202)).
- Reject oversized `FindBlocks` responses before they enter the syncer's
  discovered-hash reserve ([#207](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/207)).
- Build the verbose `getrawmempool` transaction-ID index once per response
  instead of once per mempool transaction, removing quadratic work from large
  mempools ([#203](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/203)).
- Weight Sapling batch verification by spend and output proof count rather than
  bundle count, so batch limits bound the actual Groth16 verification work
  submitted to one blocking task
  ([#150](https://github.com/zakura-core/zakura/pull/150)).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial release of Zakura.

Zakura is a fork of the Zcash Foundation's
[Zebra](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra), forked at Zebra v5.0.0. For
the history of this codebase before the fork, see
[upstream's CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
