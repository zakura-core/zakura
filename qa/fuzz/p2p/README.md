# P2P machine fuzzing

This isolated `cargo-fuzz` package is intentionally not a workspace member.
Each target drives one pure P2P machine from fuzz bytes and checks it against
an independent model after every input. A target panics with the property ID
that the machine broke.

Run a target from this directory with a pinned nightly toolchain. Pass
`--fuzz-dir .`, because `cargo-fuzz` otherwise looks for `fuzz/` under the
workspace root:

```console
cargo +nightly-2026-07-15 fuzz run --fuzz-dir . service_session
```

The `service_session` target replays one connection's inputs
to the service-session state in
`crates/zakura-network/src/zakura/handler/service_session/state.rs` and checks
`session/offer-assembly`, `session/one-active-generation`, and
`session/legal-reopen`. Its first input byte selects the opening policy and
connection roles; the rest selects inputs.

The input decoding, the model, and the checks live in `zakura-network` behind
the `p2p-fuzz` feature, so the machine types stay private to the crate. A unit
test there runs the same entry over fixed seeds in every test run.

`cargo-fuzz` creates and updates each target's local `corpus/` and `artifacts/`
directories; both are intentionally ignored by Git.

When libFuzzer reports a failure, reproduce and minimize the artifact:

```console
cargo +nightly-2026-07-15 fuzz run --fuzz-dir . service_session path/to/crash-artifact
cargo +nightly-2026-07-15 fuzz tmin --fuzz-dir . service_session path/to/crash-artifact
```

Turn every confirmed bug into a normal deterministic test in the owning crate.
Do not commit raw or minimized corpus files.

## Cadence target

`cadence` calls the production sender's hold decision and synchronous send path
for two rows sharing one queue. Its independent ledger checks `cadence/hold`
and `cadence/settlement`. A receive settles the real frame guard. This boundary
does not exercise scheduled transport writes.

Decoder version 1 reads at most 512 bytes. Each byte chooses update, elapsed
seconds, send or settlement. The fixed witness exercises pacing, an unwritten
frame, a full queue and settlement. Planted failures break pacing and ownership.
Proptest and cargo-fuzz call `replay_cadence_bytes`.

Run the applicability witnesses with `cargo test -p zakura-network --lib
cadence_witness -- --nocapture` from the repository root. Their printed counters
are witness evidence; they do not claim applicability for every fuzz input.
An empty input has zero applicability.

No CI workflow schedules this target or the machine targets below. Run them
with `cargo fuzz run` as shown above.
Machine bytes are compatible with their target and decoder version. They are
not portable simulator traces. The planned P1 registry will index these local
property IDs and their witness paths.

## Block machine targets

These targets call the independent models beside the production pure owners.
The `p2p-fuzz` feature exposes the drivers. The targets do not start QUIC or the
simulator step loop.

| Target | Property | Decoder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block_work_ownership` | `block/work-ownership` | 1 |
| `block_peer_registry` | `block/peer-registry` | 1 |
| `block_retry_authority` | `block/retry-authority` | 1 |
| `block_query` | `block/query-dispatch`, `block/query-completion` | 1 |
| `block_reactor` | `block/reactor-policy` | 2 |
| `block_fill` | `block/fill-retry-run`, `block/fill-retained-funding`, `block/fill-commit-window` | 1 |
| `block_request_lifecycle` | `block/request-lifecycle` | 1 |

Each decoder reads at most 512 bytes. Each model checks the state after every
operation. The colocated tests retain nonzero witnesses and planted failures.
Those tests establish logical behavior. They do not establish runtime resource
retention or full semantic trace replay.

Run targets manually with a compatible nightly toolchain and cargo-fuzz:

```sh
cargo +nightly fuzz run --fuzz-dir qa/fuzz/p2p block_work_ownership -- -max_len=512
```

This package preserves the three drivers from PR #1679, change
`d17393bea6a5f32633fb29b82426fd7b82b1b086`, at reviewed head
`d4fc17f468487d03b3b554dade009bf2538be95b`. The head's later witness-message
correction remains intact. Decoder 1 keeps the original byte interpretation.
`block_query` and `block_reactor` preserve the query portion of PR #1677 and the
reactor model from PR #1683. `block_query` generates accepted and refused
proposals, exact and stale replies, resets, authority changes, and retry expiry.
Its identity ledger calls no production policy helper. `block_reactor` shares the
reactor policy model with proptest and covers view mirrors, reaction epochs, reset
refills, query refusal, retry expiry, and authority changes. Decoder 2 of
`block_reactor` adds a closed-channel refusal to bit 16 of the refill byte. No
committed corpus uses decoder 1. Both decide pure
transitions. Runtime witnesses cover the action channel and storage waits.


`block_fill` comes from PR #1677, head
`7aef27b246dcf8f0d3625d598553d2a827411ea0`. Decoder 1 keeps that byte layout, and
its funding check now runs through queue admission. The driver takes up to 30
items, which the one-block production cap does not reach.
`block_request_lifecycle` comes from PR #1679 and tracks requests,
transport-start facts, and no-progress charges. Its witness expires one written
request and one unwritten request, matches a replacement request, and resets the
remaining window. Other machine
targets follow their owning delivery packets. Shared replay integration and
campaign scheduling remain open. No fuzz campaign blocks PR CI.

## Sequencer targets

| Target | Property | Decoder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block_sequencer_order` | `block/contiguous-submission` | 1 |
| `block_sequencer_reset` | `block/retired-apply-isolation` | 1 |
| `block_sequencer_evidence` | `block/required-evidence` | 1 |

These targets preserve PR #1680 at
`3bc8261c6d1a0c1ec1daf55d361f5a33e34b5a8d`. Each target uses the independent
model from its proptest driver. Ordering and evidence consume three-byte
operations. Reset consumes one byte for the retired-apply count, then three-byte
operations. Each decoder reads at most 512 bytes. Empty input reports zero
applicability. Setup transitions do not count as generated coverage.

The ordering witness retries a refused contiguous submission. The reset witness
completes a retired apply while current work remains. The evidence witness holds
required evidence through modeled backpressure, then delivers it. Planted state
corruption must fail the intended model check. These checks do not establish
production-mutation detection, decoded-memory retention, actual channel delivery,
or fresh-process semantic replay. The block fixture copies public mainnet block
1 from `zakura-test/src/vectors/block-main-0-000-001.txt`.
