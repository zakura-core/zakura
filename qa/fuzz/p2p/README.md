# P2P machine fuzzing

This isolated `cargo-fuzz` package is intentionally not a workspace member.
Each target drives one pure P2P machine from fuzz bytes and checks it against
an independent model after every input. A target panics with the property ID
that the machine broke.

Run a target from this directory with a pinned nightly toolchain. Pass
`--fuzz-dir .`, because `cargo-fuzz` otherwise looks for `fuzz/` under the
workspace root:

```console
cargo +nightly-2026-07-15 fuzz run --fuzz-dir . service_session
```

The available target is `service_session`. It replays one connection's inputs
to the service-session state in
`crates/zakura-network/src/zakura/handler/service_session/state.rs` and checks
`session/offer-assembly`, `session/one-active-generation`, and
`session/legal-reopen`. Its first input byte selects the opening policy and
connection roles; the rest selects inputs.

The input decoding, the model, and the checks live in `zakura-network` behind
the `p2p-fuzz` feature, so the machine types stay private to the crate. A unit
test there runs the same entry over fixed seeds in every test run.

`cargo-fuzz` creates and updates each target's local `corpus/` and `artifacts/`
directories; both are intentionally ignored by Git.

When libFuzzer reports a failure, reproduce and minimize the artifact:

```console
cargo +nightly-2026-07-15 fuzz run --fuzz-dir . service_session path/to/crash-artifact
cargo +nightly-2026-07-15 fuzz tmin --fuzz-dir . service_session path/to/crash-artifact
```

Turn every confirmed bug into a normal deterministic test in the owning crate.
Do not commit raw or minimized corpus files.
